# Codetrek

This is a framework designed for CLC teachers to create course material, outlines, quizes, exercises to provide to the students and track lesson progress in real time and be able to offer live support. Students will be able to join a session (lesson) virtually and be able to consume lesson content and if needed be able to get virtual support from the teacher.
