# DigiKnow

## Problem Statement
How do we empower Canadians with lower digital literacy levels or who are intimidated by technology to understand the importance of digital literacy for themselves or their children?

## Our Solution
DigiKnow is a mobile app that encourages users to improve their digital literacy. This app uses a point-based incentive system to encourage the user to take daily digital literacy "quizes" which would be a fun way of gaining more information about various digital issues. These points can then be redeemed for various rewards.
